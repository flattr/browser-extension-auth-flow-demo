# Documentation and demo for an example Flattr Extension

This repository aims to describe how Flattr could be integrated
into an extension in order for the extension to be able to relay to websites
whether or not the browsing user is a paying Flattr user.

The 3 parts involved in this are: The Flattr website ([flattr.com](https://flattr.com)) and API, the
extension and the visited website.

The documentation will focus on each part separately and try to explain how they are used and by whom.

1. [Flattr website and API](api/README.md)
2. [Extension](extension/README.md)
3. [Publisher website](publisher-website/README.md)
